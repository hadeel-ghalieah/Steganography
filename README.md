# Image Steganography

This Python program enables you to hide and retrieve secret messages within images using steganography. Steganography is the practice of concealing one piece of information within another, and in this case, hiding text messages within image files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.x)
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
- Pillow (`pip install pillow`)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-steganography.git













Choose between encoding a message into an image or decoding a message from an encoded image.

Encoding a Message
Enter the image name (e.g., example.png) when prompted.
Enter the message you want to hide.
Enter the name for the encoded image (with a valid extension, e.g., .png).
Decoding a Message
Enter the encoded image name (e.g., encoded_example.png) when prompted.
The hidden message will be displayed.
